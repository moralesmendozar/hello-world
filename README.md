This is how I learn to do a Repository

I am learning to do a Repository and I would love to use this to work on Python. What I do not know right now is how to add the Python sort of code-compatibility that I could select when creating a new repository. Oh, well, I guess I will have to either create a new repository, explore (be creative at it) or simple google it (or bing it? haha, no one uses bing).

adding a Change...
